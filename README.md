XEMU Repair:

-2.Select your ISO    
-3.Select your Save Location    
-4.Click REPAIR    
-5.Wait for the Black Command window to close

NOTE:               
-Most if not all XBOX Redumps are around 7.6GB.

-If the game you're trying to Repair is below 7.3GB, it's probably not
an XBOX Redump and possibly won't work with XEMU or the Repair Tool.

-In this case you will need to find another dump of the game since it was 
improperly dumped and isn't XEMU or the Repair Tools fault.

-It's been reported that improperly dumped XBOX games may still
BOOT on CXBX but will not BOOT on XEMU.
